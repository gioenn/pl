exercise 1

define the "gcd" function.

gcd takes two numbers as input and computes the great commom divisor between the two. 

examples:

(gcd 8 28) -> 4
(gcd 11 98) -> 1

---

exercise 2

define the "nested-length" function.

nested-length takes a list as argument and returns the number of element inside the list and all the nested lists.

examples:

(nested-length '(1 2 3)) -> 3
(nested-length '(1 2 (2 (5 4)) 5 6)) -> 7

---

exercise 3

define the "print-matrix" function.

print-matrix takes a matrix as argument (a matrix is a vector of vectors, e.g. #(#(1 2) #(3 4)) is a 2x2 matrix) 
and prints out the content of the matrix as in following examples.

examples:

> (print-matrix #(#(1 2) #(3 4)))
1    2
3    4

> (print-matrix #(1 2 3))
1	
2
3

exercise 4

define the "vector*!" function.

vector*! takes three vectors (v1 v2 v3) as arguments. 
this function will consider v2 a Nx1 matrix, v3 a 1xM matrix; v1 must be a mutable vector of size N.
this function computes the multiplication between v2 and v3 and saves the resulting NxM matrix in v1.

example:

> (define v1 (make-vector 2))      
> (vector*! v1 #(3 2) #(4 5))
> (print-matrix v1)
12   15
8    10
> (vector*! v1 #(5 2) #(1 1 0))
> (print-matrix v1)
5    5    0
2    2    0

---

exercise 5

define the "zip" function.

zip takes two lists as arguments. it returns a list of lists, where the i-th list contains the i-th element from each input list. 
the returned list is truncated in length to the length of the shortest argument list. 

examples: 

(zip '(1 2 3) '(4 5 6)) -> '((1 4) (2 5) (3 6))
(zip '(a 4 d) '(2 c)) -> '((a 2) (4 c))

---

exercise 6

define the "split" function.

split takes two arguments: a list and a splitter value. 
it returns a list of lists in which each list is the sublist of the input list between two occurences of the splitter value.

examples: 

(split '(a b c x d x e x f) 'x) -> '((a b c) (d) (e) (f))
(split '(0 1 2 0 2 0 3 0) 0) -> '((1 2) (2) (3))

---

exercise 7

define the "takewhile" function.

takewhile takes two arguments: a predicate and a list. it returns the elements of the list until the predicate is violated.

examples: 

(takewhile odd? '(1 5 7 8 1 4 6 9)) -> '(1 5 7)
(takewhile positive? '(5 11 4 2 -2 5 6) -> '(5 11 4 2)

---

exercise 8

define the "flatmap" function.

flatmap is similar to map but it works also for nested lists. it returns a flatten list.

examples: 

(flatmap square '(((1 2 3) 4) 0 (6 7) 8)) -> '(1 4 9 16 0 36 49 64)
(flatmap (lambda(x) (+ x 1)) '(5 (11) ((12 23) 5))) -> '(6 12 13 24 6)

---

exercise 9

define the "on-sign" macro.

on-sign choose between three branches depending if the value considered is greater than zero, equals to zero, or less than zero.
this macro has the following syntax:
(on-sign <my expr> pos: <block of code> zero: <block of code> neg: <block of code>) 

examples:

(on-sign 2
         pos: 'a
         zero: 'b
         neg: 'c) -> 'a

> (on-sign (- 5 6)
          pos: (begin (display "positive") (newline))
          zero: (begin (display "zero") (newline))
          neg: (begin (display "negative") (newline)))
negative
